# Binary Image Classifier with Streamlit Deployment

## Introduction

This repository contains a binary image classifier that distinguishes between two classes: Happy and Sad. The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras. The project includes a Streamlit app for easy deployment and interaction with the classifier.

## Model

The pre-trained model file is available at `models/Image.h5`. The model has been trained on a dataset of Happy and Sad images, achieving high accuracy in binary classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training is stored in the `data` directory. Images are organized into subdirectories for each class. The dataset is diverse and representative of the binary classification task.

## Streamlit Deployment

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Install required libraries:
